Topo & The Widgets!
===================

This document explains the widget modules in ``mom6_bathy``.

``mom6_bathy`` comes with three UI modules/classes that wrap the three main
classes—``VGrid``, ``Grid``, and ``Topo``—to help with creating vertical grids
(``VGridCreator``), horizontal grids (``GridCreator``), and editing topography
(```TopoEditor``).

The creators act as visual wrappers around the constructors of their respective
classes, providing sliders and visualizations. They automatically generate
folders called ``VgridLibrary`` and ``GridLibrary`` to store created grids.  
The currently selected grid is directly accessible as an object inside each
creator.

Topo & TopoEditor
-----------------

The ``Topo`` & ``TopoEditor`` workflow is a bit more nuanced.

Grids are simple: they are created once and rarely modified. ``Topo`` objects,
however, are built on top of the horizontal grid and are heavily edited during
the development cycle (filling bays, deepening ridges, etc.).

Because of this, ``Topo`` has many editing functions. ``TopoEditor`` provides a
visual, point-and-click interface on top of these functions.

Current editing functions (``*`` = available in ``TopoEditor``):

1. * Edit depth at a specific point
2. * Edit the minimum depth
3. * Erase a basin at a selected point
4. * Erase every basin except the one containing the selected point
5. Generate and apply an ocean mask from a land-fraction dataset
6. Apply a ridge to the bathymetry

You can also reapply an initializer (technical edits not supported in the GUI):

1. Set flat bathy
2. Set spoon bathy
3. Set bowl bathy
4. Set from dataset
5. Set from previous topo object

To support the iterative editing process, we provide **undo and redo**
functionality across sessions. This requires maintaining a structured history,
stored inside a directory associated with your ``Topo`` object.

This folder contains:

1. The grid underlying the topo
2. The original blank topo
3. A temporary command history (session-only)
4. A permanent command history (saved on disk; synced only when saving)

How It Works
------------

1. You create your ``Topo`` object, which initializes the four files above.
2. You make changes using ``Topo`` or ``TopoEditor``.
3. Each change is added to the temporary history and, when saved, to the permanent history.
4. Each change is then **committed via Git**—this powers undo/redo.

Topo Git Functionality and How to Use It
---------------------

We use Git to implement undo/redo functionality inside the topo directory.

You can view the history with:

``git log``

The temporary command history is a JSON file mapping commit SHAs to change
metadata. You can cross-reference the Git log with this JSON file to inspect
details of each edit.

We also support simple version-control actions:

- ``topo.tcm.create_branch("branchname")`` — create a branch  
- ``topo.tcm.checkout("branchname")`` — switch branches  
- ``topo.tcm.tag("tagname")`` — create a tag and save a ``tagname_topog.nc`` file  

Tags cannot be checked out (this can cause unexpected states).

Undo and redo:

- ``topo.tcm.undo()``
- ``topo.tcm.redo()``

These appear in the Git log as:

- ``UNDO-<sha>``
- ``REDO-<sha>``

Be careful not to undo your initial set-function!

.. warning::

   Do **not** run Git commands inside this folder except for ``git log --oneline``.
   We manage the folder internally. External Git commands (like ``git checkout``)
   may break state management.

Nuances (Initialization, Naming, etc.)
--------------------------------------

Folders are named after the hash of the grid's ``tlon`` variable.  
This means that **any topo using the same grid** will share the same folder.

You can initialize ``Topo`` in three ways:

1. ``Topo()`` — creates an empty topo with the provided minimum depth
2. ``Topo.from_version_control(path)`` — loads a folder, applies saved history, and returns the reconstructed topo
3. ``Topo.from_topo_file(file)`` — loads a topo file and applies it on top of any existing changes in the folder
